Registers users as affiliates after their link is used for the first time. Creates a matching WooCommerce coupon.

== Description ==

There are three parts to this plugin:

1. Automatically registers existing users as affiliates when their username is used as an affiliate reference the first time.
2. Create a WooCommerce coupon for the affiliate.
3. Apply the affiliate's WooCommerce coupon to the customer's cart.

Benefits:

1. Users can be given affiliate URLs (using their WordPress username) without needing them to be pre-registered.
2. Automatically create coupons for affiliates so their audience receives a discount.
3. Automatically apply that coupon to save the customers a step.



If an affiliate link's WordPress username does not match an existing Affiliate ID, create a new Affilate.




== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this require WooCommerce =

No, the affiliate registration step will work without WooCommerce. Think of the coupon step as an optional extra.
