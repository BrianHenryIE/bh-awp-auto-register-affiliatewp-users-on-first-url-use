Registers users as affiliates after their link is used for the first time. Creates a matching WooCommerce coupon.

== Description ==

There are three optional parts to this plugin:

1. Automatically registers existing users as affiliates when their username is used as an affiliate reference the first time.
2. Create a WooCommerce coupon for the affiliate.
3. Apply the affiliate's WooCommerce coupon to the customer's cart.

Benefits:

1. Users can be given affiliate URLs (using their WordPress username) without needing them to be pre-registered.
2. Automatically create coupons for affiliates so their audience receives a discount.
3. Automatically apply that coupon to save the customers a step.



If an affiliate link's Username does not match an existing Affiliate ID, create a new Affilate.

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

Titles are optional, naturally.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
